# Focused regression checks

From the repository root, with Python 3 (standard library only):

```sh
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

The buffer-binding checks guard the source call boundary: both index refills
must commit an index binding, while the wide-vertex refill must only unlock its
vertex buffer. They do not execute native WoW APIs or prove renderer behavior.
Build the Win32 DLL and retest the same model in the client for that verdict.
