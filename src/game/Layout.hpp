/**
 * @brief CLayoutFrame, the base a frame and a region share, seen through its scale.
 *
 * The era already lays a region out at size * scale with its anchor offsets scaled to match --
 * CLayoutFrame::Left is Right - GetWidth() * scale and the anchor resolver multiplies each stored
 * offset by the same field. What it lacks is any way for a REGION to hold a scale of its own: only
 * CSimpleFrame has an own-scale field, and a region's copy of the shared one is overwritten with the
 * parent's effective scale whenever the parent's changes.
 *
 * So the gap is a place to keep the region's own factor and a point at which to fold it back in, not
 * any part of the layout math.
