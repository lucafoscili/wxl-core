/**
 * @brief Read access to the engine's programmable-shader selection state.
 *
 * Anything outside the core that wants to know WHICH shader permutation is about to be bound has two
 * bad options and this third one: include the offsets tree directly (which is the SDK boundary an
 * extension exists on the far side of), or copy the addresses into itself (which forks the single
 * place a client rebase is applied). This facade is the third option -- the addresses stay pinned in
 * one file, and callers reach them as `shader::off::...` alongside the readers below.
 *
 * Every reader here is a raw load and nothing more. What a value MEANS -- which permutation is worth
 * naming, which collection is "the character shader" -- is policy that changes with whatever is being
 * built on top, so it belongs to the caller and deliberately has no representation here.
