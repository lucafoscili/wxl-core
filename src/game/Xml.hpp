/**
 * @brief The XML load path, as a detour sees it.
 *
 * The parser does not reject what it does not know: an attribute nobody reads is parsed, stored on
 * the node, and never looked at. So teaching the client a new attribute or element is adding a read,
 * never making the parser accept one -- attach after a type's LoadXML and read the node yourself.
 *
 * Every frame and region type funnels through one such entry, CScriptRegion::LoadXML, which is also
 * where the client's own parentKey lives. An object's Lua table is reachable from there: the
 * FrameScript_Object base sits a fixed distance behind the region pointer LoadXML is invoked on, and
 * carries a LUA_REGISTRYINDEX reference to the table Lua sees as the frame.
 *
 * An <AnimationGroup> and an <Animation> are outside that funnel -- they are not regions -- and each
 * has its own entry, kAnimGroupLoadXML and kAnimLoadXML. Their LoadXML is invoked on the
 * FrameScript_Object base itself, so PushScriptObject takes the `this` unshifted.

     * The era HAS reverse playback; what it has no way to do is ask for it. CSimpleAnimGroup::Play
     * picks its direction from the order cursor it is entered with -- below zero it plays forwards
     * from the first order, at or past the end it plays backwards from the last -- and nothing in
     * the binary ever leaves the cursor in the second state, so the branch is unreachable from Lua.
     * Standing the cursor at the order count and calling Play is that branch's entry: from there the
     * client does the whole of the work itself, copying the backwards state into every animation of
     * the group and starting the last order's reverse-sorted list.
     *
     * Reverse is then a property of the PROGRESS, not of the values: CSimpleAnim::UpdateProgress
     * hands each apply entry `1 - t` instead of `t`, before the animation's curve object, so a
     * <Scale> runs from toScale to fromScale, an <Alpha> from toAlpha to fromAlpha, and a <Path> --
     * whose apply evaluates one position from one parameter, the control-point offsets being
     * absolute displacements from the region's anchored place rather than steps -- walks its
     * polyline from the last control point back to (0, 0).
     *
     * A group already playing is STOPPED FIRST, with `requested` false. Play on a live group is a
     * no-op in this era, so without that a second call inside one play would do nothing at all;
     * stopping is also what unregisters the group from its object, so the Play that follows
     * registers it exactly once, and it is what puts every animation back to un-started. The cost is
     * an OnStop handler seeing a restart, which retail's own restart does not fire.
     *
     * The cursor is RESTORED when nothing consumed it. Play has two refusals that return before the
     * direction branch -- an empty animation list, and a group already playing and not paused, which
     * is reachable re-entrantly from a handler running inside the client's own stop -- and each would
     * otherwise leave the cursor standing at the order count with no play behind it. A later forward
     * Play reads such a cursor as neither end of the array, takes no branch, and leaves the group
     * started and never advanced. Finding the cursor still at the order count afterwards is the exact
     * test for that: the backwards branch moves it to orderCount - 1, and a handler that stopped the
     * group from inside OnPlay has moved it to -1.
     *
     * Play has one further early branch, on the finished flag 0x10 of the group's flag word, which
     * resets the cursor to -1 and would play FORWARDS over the write below. It is unreachable from
     * here: that flag is only ever set together with a non-zero play state, inside the window where
     * the client's own advance runs OnFinished, and the stop above clears the whole flag word.
