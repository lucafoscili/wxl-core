// A submesh's first triangle index is (level << 16) | indexStart. indexStart alone stops addressing
// at 65535, so that pairing is the only way a skin larger than that can say where a submesh begins.
// Both of the client's index-buffer fills read indexStart as a plain 16-bit field, so every submesh
// past the ceiling sources its triangles from the wrong place -- the geometry is in the file, the
// fill just looks 65536 indices too early.
//
// level also had an older life as a LOD / sub-batch marker, so the fold is conditional: it is taken
// only when the widened start plus the submesh's own index count still lands inside the triangle
// array the skin itself declares. A marker names an offset that array cannot contain, so it is
// rejected and the client's own 16-bit reading stands. Two consequences worth stating: a skin that
// is not writing an extended start is filled by the untouched engine function, and no value of
// level can make the fill read outside the array it is reading from.

     * only somewhere the full value fits, which this is.
     *
     * The same conditional fold the fills use: level had an older life as a marker, so the widened
     * start is taken only when it and the submesh's own count still land inside the triangle array
     * the skin declares. The low half is checked against the section too, so a descriptor that is
